#tic tac toe game

#in this project 
#Here is how we approach in development of this project:

#1. 2 players should be able to play the game.
#2. The board should be printed out every time any of the player makes a move
#3. You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board


#we generate board for game and set rules for detection for which player wins in this 3x3 board horizontal ,vertical &diagonal matches  
#setup for how to remove positions after taken selected symbols and game logic
